        A Reference to another Entity, used to track access via a specific channel.
        For example in TabTab, a Post has many shortIds which relate to different sharing
        methods, e.g. one for Twitter, one for Yammer, one for Email, etc... We use them
        as 'short urls' in the App and redirect the user to the correct content after tracking
        the access by the channel (`ogit/function`) attribute.
        The `ogit/id` attribute in this instance would be a short URL safe string.
