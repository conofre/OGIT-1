- Verb:
    id: http://www.purl.org/ogit/mentions
    name: mentions
    description: |
        This verb was envisaged to represent the *Social Media* menaing of the word mention (or
        the Twitter-ism *at-mention*). However it simple represents that one entity mentions another,
        for example cross-references in documentation would also be a valid use-case.
